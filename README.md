 💡 Dream-to-App Generator

An AI-powered project that turns your **ideas into working Streamlit apps** ✨.  
This project was developed during my **industrial training at Zeetron Networks**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Many people have creative ideas but lack the technical skills to convert them into applications.  
**Dream-to-App Generator** solves this problem by allowing users to **enter an idea in plain text**, and the system automatically generates a **working Streamlit application**.

---

## 🎯 Features
- 🔐 **User Authentication** – Secure login & signup system with password hashing.  
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Code Generation** – Uses **Google Gemini API with LangChain** to generate code.  
- 📂 **Multi-file Project Support** – Well-structured code with multiple files.  
- 🧹 **Code Formatting & Linting** – Ensures clean, readable, and optimized code.  
- 📦 **Download & Deployment** – Export projects as ZIP files with requirements, Dockerfile, and Procfile.  
- ⏳ **History & Versioning** – Every generated project is saved with rollback support.  
- 🎨 **Light & Dark Themes** – Customizable UI for better experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend/UI** → [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)  
- **AI Model** → Google **Gemini API** via [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)  
- **Authentication** → bcrypt hashing for passwords  
- **Code Quality** → Black (formatter) + Flake8 (linter)  
- **Database/Storage** → Local JSON-based storage (users, history, versions)  
- **Deployment Ready** → Dockerfile + HuggingFace Spaces compatibility
